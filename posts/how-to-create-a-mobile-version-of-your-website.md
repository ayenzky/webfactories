The mobile industry is expanding at lightning speed. In fact, new devices are being evolved every now and then. According to a study by Netmarketshare, the use of the operating system, iOS for Apple devices including iPad and iPhone, doubled in only 7-8 months. Moreover, more than 40% of Google search results now originate from smartphones and mobile devices. This clearly indicates how many people are visiting sites from their mobile devices instead of desktops and laptops. Mobile browser usage has surpassed desktop browser as well as app usage, says Morgan Stanley. Those days are gone when you had to drag, pinch and double-tab on the screen to improve the readability.

Being a business owner, you are probably always on the lookout for new ways to reach your target audience.
